# Embedded-System

## <ins>Description</ins>:

In this project, I  will create a build system using the GNU tools, GCC and GNU Make. To be more specific, compile multiple files, link them together and create a final output executable. We will need to support two platforms; the host environment and the target embedded system MSP432. While the host system will allow you to simulate software on a host platform, the target system will be used in upcoming assignments as we begin to create our microcontroller applications.

Subsequently, I write more C-programming code, and integrate your code with your build system. I will reuse your version control repository and add some new c-programming functions that manipulate memory. I will test your code on my host machine.
